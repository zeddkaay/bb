    <p>early april: after breakup i wasnt necessarily upset because i believed it was an end to a very unhealthy
        relationship. in this time i found sally, she was nice but i still wasnt sure if im over youu.
        and i figured out, i wasnt. i stopped you but ig it wasnt enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        24th april:
        it broke me apart. it was probably the worst thing happened last year. i got so angry ended up blocking you.
        i wasnt only angry but also sad. it was like i lost to someone..
        i got cuts and bruises all over my fingers from rage boxing everyday. literally had to vipe blood off 
        the punching bag everytime. although i had the best shape ever thanks to you lol. i even imagined you as
        the bag and that was the only way to kill my anger hehe. i was crazy af, driving to the mountains after midnight
        and walking there not seeing anyone for hrs straight was kinda fun but scary lol
    </p>
    <p>
        26th april: sally clutched in. i started getting back to life, she was kinda boring ngl lol but i stopped
        thinking about you :P
    </p>
